DeepEqual=DeepEqual is an extensible deep equality comparison library.Installing-Install via NuGet`Install-Package DeepEqual`Usage-To test equality simply call the `IsDeepEqual` extension method.```c#var result = object1.IsDeepEqual(object2);```When used inside a test you might want to call  `ShouldDeepEqual` instead. This method throws an exception with a detailed description of the differences between the 2 objects.```c#object1.ShouldDeepEqual(object2);```You can pass a custom comparison as the second argument to the `ShouldDeepEqual` method to override the default behaviour. You can also customize the behaviour inline using the `WithDeepEqual` extension method.```c#object1.WithDeepEqual(object2)       .SkipDefault<MyEntity>()       .IgnoreSourceProperty(x => x.Id)       .Assert()```To ignore all properties with a given name, regardless of the containing type, use the overload of IgnoreSourceProperty that takes a string.```c#object1.WithDeepEqual(object2)       .SkipDefault<MyEntity>()       .IgnoreSourceProperty("Id")       .Assert()```
