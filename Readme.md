DeepEqual=DeepEqual is an extensible deep equality comparison library.Installing-Install via NuGet`Install-Package DeepEqual`Basic Usage-To test equality simply call the `IsDeepEqual` method.```c#var result = object1.IsDeepEqual(object2);```When used inside a test you might want to call  `ShouldDeepEqual` instead. This method throws an exception with a detailed description of the differences between the 2 objects.```c#object1.ShouldDeepEqual(object2);```AdvancedUsage-You can customize the way DeepEqual compares objects. To override the default comparison you can set `ComparisonSettings.Create`.```c#ComparisonSettings.Create = () => new ComparisonBuilder()    .WithCustomComparison(myComparison)    .IgnoreUnmatchedProperties()    .IgnoreProperty<MyObject>(x => x.Id)    .Create();```This uses the `ComparisonBuilder` to customize the creation of the default comparison. The above includes a custom comparison implementation, missing properties on the source or destination are ignored, and the `Id` property on instances of `MyObject` are ignored.You can also customize the comparison inline using the `WithDeepEqual` extension method.```c#object1.WithDeepEqual(object2)       .IgnoreSourceProperty(x => x.Id)       .Assert()```
